# Automated Testing & Monitoring

## Description
Write and run automated tests and monitoring for Kafka pipelines using Java test frameworks and Kafka's CLI tools. This project demonstrates how to ensure reliability and correctness in Kafka-based systems, focusing on backend testability and observability. The solution is backend-focused, leverages the Java ecosystem, and is fully testable on a local machine.

## Topics Covered
- Kafka fundamentals (brokers, topics, partitions)
- Java producer and consumer APIs
- Unit and integration testing (JUnit, Testcontainers)
- Mock producers/consumers
- Monitoring with Kafka CLI tools
- Observability best practices
- Project structure and dependency management

## Tools
- Java (JUnit: [org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.junit.jupiter/junit-jupiter), Testcontainers: [org.testcontainers:kafka](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testcontainers/kafka), Mockito: [org.mockito:mockito-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.mockito/mockito-core))
- Docker (for Kafka and Zookeeper)
- Kafka CLI tools
- (Optional) Prometheus, Grafana for metrics
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)

## Step-by-Step Guide (General)
1. Set up Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker.
2. Scaffold a Java Maven/Gradle project for tests and monitoring.
3. Add JUnit, Testcontainers, and Mockito as dependencies.
4. Write unit tests for producers and consumers using JUnit and Mockito.
5. Use Testcontainers to spin up Kafka for integration tests.
6. Implement integration tests for end-to-end Kafka pipelines.
7. Set up basic monitoring using CLI tools (and optionally Prometheus/Grafana).

<summary>Detailed Guide (Spoiler)</summary>

### 1. Set up Kafka and Zookeeper with Docker
- Use Docker Compose as in previous projects.

### 2. Scaffold Java Project & Add Dependencies
- Use Maven or Gradle to create a new Java project for tests and monitoring.
- Add dependencies for JUnit, Testcontainers, and Mockito in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

### 3. Write Unit Tests
- Use JUnit and Mockito to test producer/consumer logic in isolation.

### 4. Integration Testing with Testcontainers
- Use Testcontainers to spin up Kafka/Zookeeper for integration tests.
- Produce and consume messages in tests to verify end-to-end flow.

### 5. Monitoring
- Use Kafka CLI tools to inspect topics and consumer groups.
- (Optional) Set up Prometheus and Grafana for advanced metrics.

## Validation Steps
1. Confirm Kafka and Zookeeper are running via Docker for integration tests.
2. Ensure all unit and integration tests pass.
3. Use CLI tools to verify event flow during tests.
4. (Optional) Validate monitoring dashboards for Kafka metrics.
5. Check application logs for errors and test results.
