# Real-Time Fraud Detection Service

## Description
Analyze transaction streams in real time to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns using Kafka Streams or ksqlDB. This project demonstrates how to build a backend fraud detection pipeline leveraging Kafka's stream processing capabilities, Java, and Docker. The solution is backend-focused, leverages the Java ecosystem, and is fully testable on a local machine.

## Topics Covered
- Kafka fundamentals (brokers, topics, partitions)
- Java producer and consumer APIs
- Kafka Streams or ksqlDB for real-time analytics
- Event serialization (JSON/Avro)
- Windowed aggregations and stateful processing
- Monitoring with Kafka CLI tools
- Project structure and dependency management

## Tools
- Java (using the official Kafka client library: [org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients) and Kafka Streams: [org.apache.kafka:kafka-streams](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.kafka/kafka-streams))
- Docker (for Kafka, Zookeeper, ksqlDB)
- Jackson ([com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind)) or Avro ([org.apache.avro:avro](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.avro/avro))
- Maven or Gradle (for dependency management)
- ksqlDB (Docker)
- Kafka CLI tools

## Step-by-Step Guide (General)
1. Set up Kafka, Zookeeper, and ksqlDB using Docker.
2. Scaffold a Java Maven/Gradle project for the pipeline.
3. Add Kafka, Kafka Streams, and serialization libraries as dependencies.
4. Create a `transactions` topic.
5. Implement a Java producer to simulate transaction events (e.g., purchases, transfers) and send to Kafka.
6. Serialize events as JSON or Avro.
7. Implement a Kafka Streams app or ksqlDB queries to detect suspicious patterns (e.g., high-frequency transactions, large amounts).
8. Output alerts to a separate topic or log.
9. Monitor event flow and topic stats with CLI tools.
10. (Optional) Add unit/integration tests for producer, processor, and consumer logic.

<summary>Detailed Guide (Spoiler)</summary>

### 1. Set up Kafka, Zookeeper, and ksqlDB with Docker
- Use Docker Compose to run all required services.

### 2. Scaffold Java Project & Add Dependencies
- Use Maven or Gradle to create a new Java project.
- Add dependencies for Kafka client, Kafka Streams, and Jackson/Avro in `pom.xml` or `build.gradle`.

### 3. Create the Topic
- Use CLI: `docker exec -it <kafka_container_id> kafka-topics --create --topic transactions --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 2 --replication-factor 1`

### 4. Implement Java Transaction Producer
- Simulate transactions (e.g., `{ "userId": "u1", "amount": 100.0, "timestamp": 1680000000000 }`).
- Serialize as JSON (Jackson) or Avro.
- Send events to `transactions` topic.

### 5. Real-Time Fraud Detection
- Use Kafka Streams or ksqlDB to process `transactions` topic.
- Detect patterns (e.g., more than X transactions in Y minutes, transactions above a threshold).
- Output alerts to an `alerts` topic or log to console.

### 6. Monitor with CLI Tools
- Use `kafka-console-consumer` to view events and alerts.
- Use `kafka-topics --describe` for topic info.

### 7. (Optional) Add Unit/Integration Tests
- Use JUnit/Testcontainers to test producer, processor, and consumer logic.

## Validation Steps
1. Confirm all services are running via Docker.
2. Verify `transactions` topic creation.
3. Ensure Java producer sends simulated transactions to Kafka.
4. Ensure Kafka Streams/ksqlDB app detects fraud patterns and outputs alerts.
5. Use CLI tools to inspect event flow and topic status.
6. Check application logs for errors and test results.
