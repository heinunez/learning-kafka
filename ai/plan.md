# Plan: Real-World Use Case Project Generation for Apache Kafka (LLM-Assisted)

## Objective
Create a set of project-based learning documents for Apache Kafka, each based on a real-world use case, leveraging topics from `contents.md`. Each project will be a standalone markdown file, following a structured template.

---

## Step-by-Step Plan

- [x] **1. Extract Topics from contents.md**
  - Review and list all major topics and subtopics covered in `contents.md`.
  - Output: Structured list of topics.

- [x] **2. Choose Structured List Strategy**
  - Consider multiple strategies for structuring the extracted topics list.
  - Document the rationale and chosen strategy in the `ai` directory.

- [x] **3. Identify Real-World Use Cases**
  - Brainstorm and select practical, real-world scenarios that require Kafka (e.g., log aggregation, event-driven microservices, real-time analytics, messaging systems, data pipelines).
  - Map each use case to relevant topics from the extracted list.
  - Output: List of use cases with mapped topics.

- [x] **4. Design Project Outlines**
  - For each use case, draft a project outline including:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Topics covered (from mapping)
    - Recommended tools
    - High-level step-by-step guide
    - Validation steps
  - Output: Project outlines for each use case.

- [x] **5. Write Project Markdown Files**
  - For each project outline, create a markdown file named `{project order}-{project name}.md`.
  - Populate the file with:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Topics covered
    - Tools
    - Step-by-step guide (general)
    - Detailed guide (in spoiler block)
    - Validation steps
  - Output: One markdown file per project.

- [x] **6. Review and Refine**
  - Check each markdown file for completeness, clarity, and alignment with `contents.md` topics.
  - Revise as needed for consistency and learning value.
  - Output: Finalized set of project markdown files.

- [x] **7. Organize and Document**
  - Create an index or README listing all projects for easy navigation.
  - Output: Index or summary document.

## Notes
- Each step should be completed before moving to the next.
- Refer to this plan throughout the implementation for guidance.
- Adjust use cases or project outlines as needed to ensure comprehensive topic coverage and practical relevance.
