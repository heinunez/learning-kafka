# Real-World Backend Scenarios Project List

This list contains 10 practical Kafka projects, each modeled after realistic backend engineering scenarios. Every project is feasible and testable on a local machine, uses Java and Docker, and collectively covers all major topics from `contents.md`.

1. **Website Analytics Platform**
   - Track and analyze website user activity in real time using Kafka for event ingestion and processing.
2. **IoT Home Data Pipeline**
   - Simulate IoT sensor data streaming from home devices, process and aggregate readings with Kafka Streams.
3. **E-commerce Order Processing**
   - Build an order pipeline with transactional event processing, exactly-once guarantees, and schema validation.
4. **Centralized Logging Solution**
   - Aggregate logs from multiple local applications/services into Kafka, process and visualize logs.
5. **Real-Time Fraud Detection Service**
   - Analyze transaction streams in real time to detect anomalies or suspicious patterns using Kafka Streams or ksqlDB.
6. **Customer Notification Microservice**
   - Implement an event-driven notification system (email/SMS/push) powered by Kafka topics and consumers.
7. **Data Lake Ingestion & ETL**
   - Use Kafka Connect to ingest, transform, and load data from various sources into a local data lake or database.
8. **Social Media Trending Topics Analyzer**
   - Process and analyze social media streams to detect trending topics using windowed aggregations and stateful processing.
9. **Microservice Coordination with Kafka**
   - Orchestrate communication and coordination between multiple backend microservices using Kafka as the event bus.
10. **Automated Testing & Monitoring**
    - Write and run automated tests and monitoring for Kafka pipelines using Java test frameworks and Kafka's CLI tools.
