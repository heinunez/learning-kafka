# Initial
I want to create a list of projects based on Project based Learning methodology focused in learning about Apache Kafka. These projects must be based on @contents.md . Lets build the list based on the following specs:  

- Every project will be in a separated markdown file with the filename formated as {project order}-{project name}.md
- The content for every project document will be the following: title, description, topics that will cover (extracted from @contents.md ), tools (tools recomended to use for the implementation of the project), step by step guide (general guide without details), detailed guide (same guide as before but with all the details, this part of the content must be in spoiler block), step to step to validate the results  
  
With this in mind, I want you to first think about a few possible approaches before landing on the best one. Provide reasoning why this would be the best approach. Remember we're we don't need to create an enterprise-level app (it will be for personal use)

# Plan
I want to proceed with the Approach 3: Real world use case projects. Create an actionable, step-by-step plan that we can use as a guide for LLM-assisted coding. Before you create the plan, think about a few different plan styles that would be suitable for this project and the implementation style before selecting the best one. Give your reasoning for why you think we should use this plan style. Remember that we will constantly refer to this plan to guide our coding implementation so it should be well structured, concise, and actionable, while still providing enough information to guide the LLM. Write the plan to a new ai/plan.md document 

# First + second step
We can now proceed with the first step of @plan.md . Think about 3 possible structured lists. Chose the best strategy of these 3 and give me your rationale for choosing it. Document in @ai directory

# Step 3
given @plan.md proceed with step 3. Think about 5 lists and give me the reasoning for which be the best of every list

# Step 4
proceed with step 4 @plan.md . Think about 3 possible strategies. Choose the best and give me your rationale for choosing it

# Step 5
think in a list of 10 orijects based on the @use-case-lists.md reasoning. Use projects that i can build in a personal computer. You can list creative projects. This projects must cover the majority of @contents.md topics
