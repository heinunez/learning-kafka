# Step 4: Project Outline Design Strategy

## Strategies Considered

1. **Uniform Template Strategy**
   - Use a single, strict template for all project outlines (title, description, topics, tools, steps, validation).
2. **Use-Case Tailored Strategy**
   - Customize the outline structure for each project based on its complexity or domain.
3. **Progressive Detail Strategy**
   - Start with a minimal outline for simple projects, add more detail for advanced ones.

## Chosen Strategy: Uniform Template

**Rationale:**
- Guarantees consistency across all projects.
- Eases automation and validation.
- Simplifies learning and comparison.
- Easily extensible for future needs.
